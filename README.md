# Project-0

This project is based on `python`. 
## Requirements
Your system must be having Python V3 for `Execution`.
You must have a server in which you must be running the `server.py`.

## Defining the Server IP 
You must specify or initialize the `server IP` adress in `host` variable in the `client.py` file, inorder to receive the connections over the server.
Since the predefined value is not the server address u can communicate|Establish connection.

## Run
There is no need of changing any values `predefined` in the `server.py`.
You may change the `port` address -> Predefined (`9999`).
Initially when you run the `server.py` it starts receiving connections over the server that is specified in the `client.py->host` variable.
Make sure you run the `server.py` file over the server that is defined in host variable in `client.py`.

## Working
When the client.py is active, u will be getting the message as `Connection has been established...` on the screen.
Now you can give commands to the client system over the server.
